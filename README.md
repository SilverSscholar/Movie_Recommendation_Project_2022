# Movie_Recommendation_Project_2022
This project is a movie recommendation application. It will allow users to search for specific movies. What this project does is it uses two available datasets to determine what kind of movie the user would be interested in based on a ratings.csv and movies.csv extending from 2006-2016. Once the project reaches it's completion you should be able to Type in the title of a movie, and get a suggestions of movies. These suggestions are determined by what movies have been seen by other users and their recommendation score. I do hope that you emjoy my project.
